Firmware for ESP based devices for home automation

AFE Firmware is software written for the ESP8266 / 8285 / 32 microcontrollers, which is more and more often found in commercial products. ESP is relatively cheap and enables to create your own modules almost like building blocks. The module with AFE Firmware is mainly used in intelligent homes. The modules can control lighting, gates, garden irrigation system, as well as read various parameters: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, suspended pollen and many more.

The module with AFE Firmware installed can be wirelessly controlled by automation systems such as openHAB, Domoticz, Domotiga, HomeAssistant and probably by many other automation systems.
