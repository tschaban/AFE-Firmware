ESP is relatively cheap and enables to create your own modules almost like building blocks. The module with AFE Firmware is mainly used in intelligent homes. The modules can control lighting, gates, garden irrigation system, as well as read various parameters: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, suspended pollen and many more.
